# trading/strategies/predefined/__init__.py

"""
This package contains predefined, concrete trading strategy implementations
that inherit from TradingStrategyBase.
"""
# As you add strategies like SMACrossoverStrategy, RSIStrategy, etc.,
# you could optionally import them here to make them available as:
# from app.trading.strategies.predefined import SMACrossoverStrategy
#
# For example, if you create sma_crossover.py:
# from .sma_crossover import SMACrossoverStrategy
# __all__ = ["SMACrossoverStrategy"]
#
# For now, it can be empty if you prefer to import strategies directly
# from their specific modules.
